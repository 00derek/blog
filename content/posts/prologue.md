## Why
Now my notes are all collected through [Notion](http://notion.so/), I highly recommend it.  But I think it may be also good to publish my notes somewhere 1. just in case 2. someone may find it helpful 3. Because I want to?

## Who
Anyone? Leave me your comments.

## What
I guess it will be mainly technical notes for now, I haven't given a lot of thoughts of what to journal yet.  So yeah, it's random stuff.

## Where
It's hosted on [Github](https://00derek.github.io), [source](https://github.com/00derek/blog) too.  

## How
It's powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a note about the [setup](../hugo_site/)
